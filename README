Please read the COPYING file first.

This folder (should) contain :

- A cvs 1.10 folder (Mac/Win) : the cvs 1.10 distribution : most of the differences
are located into cvs-1.10/macintosh and client.c because this version
improves a lot the Macintosh port. Some other changes in cvs 1.10 are due
to the CvsGui architecture and makes cvs 1.10 behave a little bit
differently.
- A cvs-1.10 folder : It contains a cvs 1.10 source code distribution
altered in order to communicate using pipes with a process
(cvs-1.10/lib/cvsgui.*).
- A common folder : the common source code part for the CvsGui applications.
- A cvstree folder : the common source code part for reverse cvs log parser.
- A MacCvs folder : the Macintosh specific source code for MacCvs.
- A WinCvs folder : the Windows specific source code for WinCvs.
- A GuiDoc folder : includes the (tiny) documentation for CvsGui
and some specific features for each ports.
- A ChangeLog : the recent changes in the source code.
- A mpw folder (Mac) : MPW tools for Macintosh.
