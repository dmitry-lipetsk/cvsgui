- This is the cvstree library which allows to parse the cvs log output.
Look at CvsLog.h to get an idea of how the API works.

- The yacc/lexer have a suffix .yy/.ll because automake will automatically
generate parser.cc and lexer.cc to be used with a C++ compiler. Because the
".cc" extension may be a problem, parser.cpp and lexer.cpp are provided and
will include parser.cc and lexer.cc.

- *.dsp are the M$ VisualC++ projects. The compat folder is provided for
VisualC++ which lacks unistd.h.
