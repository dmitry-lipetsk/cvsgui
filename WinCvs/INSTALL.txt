Few additional notes about WinCvs :

In order to use WinCvs you need the application WinCvs.exe,
plus :

1) Python 2.1 or better (http://www.python.org).

2) "cvs.exe" and "cvs95.exe" are based upon cvs 1.11 code and
are part of the cvsnt project (http://www.cvsnt.org)

3) You need to set-up some environment variables in
order to use cvs.exe in a dos command (unused by WinCvs) :

HOME : the location for cvs to find global settings files
(.cvspass, .cvsignore, .cvsrc)...
PATH : needs to point out the WinCvs folder.
CVSROOT : your CVSROOT.
CVS_RSH : for use with ssh.

4) WinCvs supports only cvs 1.10 server and higher.

Enjoy !
