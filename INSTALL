About gcvs
==========

   gcvs is currently in his first stage of developement.

   This program is part of the CvsGui project, a set of cvs front-end
   applications which use a native framework for each platform. More
   informations can be found on the existing applications (MacCvs and
   WinCvs) on the GvsGui main page http://www.wincvs.org.

   gcvs is not fully functional yet : Only some capabilities are
   implemented so far.  But the whole thing is mostly there and the
   core of the application is working (the three panes, the buttons,
   the cvs launching...).

   Finally gcvs is looking a lot like WinCvs.

Installing gcvs
===============

   If you have updated gcvs sources by cvs you had to to 'CVS Update'.


   Tarball Update
   --------------

   You need one tararchive ("XX" stands for the minor version number):

   * gcvs-1.0XX.tar.gz : the source code of gcvs. gcvs requires
     gtk 1.2 or higher (http://www.gtk.org).

   1) gzip -d -c gcvs-1.0XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   2) cd gcvs-1.0XX
   3) ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/gcvs
   4) make; make install

   5) /usr/local/gcvs/bin/gcvs


   CVS Update
   ----------
   
   At the moment you have to use a special branch for the cvs binary.
   So it is necessery to do an extra update of the cvs sources.

   I)  if you have already checkout gcvs sources:

       1) cd cvsgui
       2) cvs -q update
       3) cvs -q update -rCVSGUI1112 cvs-1.10
       4) ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/gcvs
       5) make; make install
    
       6) /usr/local/gcvs/bin/gcvs
 

   II) if you have not earlier done a checkout of gcvs:

       1) cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.cvsgui.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cvsgui login
       2) hit return for password
       3) cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.cvsgui.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cvsgui co GCvsSrc
       4) cd cvsgui
       5) cvs -q update -rCVSGUI1112 cvs-1.10
       6) ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/gcvs
       7) make; make install
    
       8) /usr/local/gcvs/bin/gcvs

   At the start-up, gcvs is asking for the CVSROOT and the
   authentication. You can change these informations later
   if you like.

   When you got the main window opened, choose the "Locate
   Browser" icon and point-out an existing checked-out copy
   or use the checkout option to create one.

   After the browser should help you to figure how to use gcvs.
   Each file/folder has a specific icon which reflects the cvs
   status. Click a folder and click the update button... You got
   the idea.
