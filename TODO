If you are a developper and want to help, enjoy !

- A powerplant architecture is now available on the Mac side so it should be
  easy to add new dialogs/features. A multi-thread application could be usefull
  especially when Matthias Neeracher will release GUSI 2.0 (4.0a0 ?).

- Many request for improved GUI : a diff viewer, a conflict solver...

- Other concerns could be : have a "real" english writer for the documentation,
  help-online on Macintosh, internationalization (i18n), complete the ISO 
  tables (4.0a0 ?)...
  
- have a look at the open tasks page on 
  https://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=10072

Others concerns, need an interface description :

- a contextual menu (right button) with some selection commands in it
  ("sort of" done on Windows, but tell me what you want to have in it).
  Done but incomplete.
  
- module creations (cf jCVS).

- external/internal visual diff (windiff, tkdiff ...). 
  Done on Windows but incomplete.

- Add backslash (*\ Data) support for cvsignore.

- Optionnaly hide ignored file (only on Windows right now).

- Mac : check Internet Config while importing for unknown types (Jack Jansen).

- Prevent the user from ending the CVSROOT with a \ or a /.

- ~/.cvsrc support.

- A Real shell with completion and regexp !

- In the graph log on WinCvs the CR shows up : first we should remove the CR
  from the log file and make sure the lexer removes it as well.
  
- "I would also really like to be able to add tags to selected
  revisions in the graph display" (Derek Scherger).
  
- Add to the .cvsignore from WinCvs. 

GCvs bugs/requests :

- select things in the output window, copy etc.

- 'Select All' selects all the files in the file view

- popup menus (Kalle <gcvs@bruenen-net.de>)

- rebuild 'Persistent::LoadAll' to do the work like WinCvs and MacCvs
  (simplify the code)

- add "reset sticky" (-A) option to checkout dialog

- add "don't shorten the module paths" (-N) option

- add watcher thread for notify the app about file changes

- adapt Jerzy changes on filtering (Kalle <gcvs@bruenen-net.de>)
- adapt Jerzy changes on tag dialogs (Kalle <gcvs@bruenen-net.de>)

- Python support

- create special classes for GUI elements to move 'UEventSendMessage' calls 
  from GUI code to library code
  
- remove redundant code elements from platform implementations
  e.g. WinCvs/GraphView.* and common/UCvsGraph.*
