Just do it !

The new unix version contains a folder named "rf" which is
intended to help porting CvsGui to several platforms. "rf"
stands for "relay framework". It's not a framework, it's
a minimal collection of tools in order to dispatch, intercept,
send, post events. In the source code, it's mentionned as
"pseudo framework". It's very light and easy to port.

As a general manner, CvsGui is using the most popular/actives
compiler and tools for the platforms in order to encourage
people to modify the source code. The project doesn't try
to use a generic multi-platform framework (like wxWINDOWS or
QT) because :

1) It never works as well as expected and on all the platforms.
2) It's unlikely to interest people who develop on one platform
to learn about a multi-platform framework.

CvsGui is encouraging platforms porting and will ultimately
integrate any of them in the main distribution.
