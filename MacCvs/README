Please read the COPYING file first located on the parent
folder.

* In order to compile MacCVS you will need:

- CodeWarrior Pro8
- Apple's Developer Tools
- PowerPlant 2.1.1.

* Tested on :

1) CW Pro 8.3, IDE 5.1.1, PowerPlant 2.1.1 (__PowerPlant__ == 0x02218000),
MSL 8.0.03 (__MSL__ == 0x00008003), December 2002 Developer Tools, Mac OS X 10.2.3 / 10.2.4

* To Build MacCVS : the folder hierarchy should look like that :
  (Make sure you've updated the "cvs-1.10" subtree to the "CVSGUI1112" branch! 
   And don't forget the option to create new folders when updating...)

+ - MacCvs 3.2 Sources
	+ - common
	+ - cvs-1.10
	+ - GuiDoc
	+ - MacCvs
		+ - Build 			: contains the projects to build MacCVS on Macintosh.
		+ - BUGS 			: known bugs in the MacCVS port.
		+ - Distrib			: contains tools to build the distribution disk image
		+ - Goodies			: some samples and misc. things for MacCVS (mostly obsolete).
		+ - GUSI20
		+ - GUSI_MSL
		+ - MachOGUSI			: thin GUSI wrapper for Mach-O
		+ - rsrc			: resources specific to MacCVS.
		+ - src 			: sources specific to MacCVS.
		+ - TCL
		+ - WASTE			: A WASTE distribution that builds in Mach-O
		+ - WText
	+ - rf

When this is set up correctly, do the following:

- using Terminal, go into cvs-1.10 and type "./autogen.sh", then "make" to build the cvsgui tool
- Open the project ":MacCvs:Build:MacCvs.CWP8.mach-o.mcp" and build the target "MacCvs all"

The Debug build will be in :MacCvs:Build:Debug:maccvsX, the release build will be in :MacCvs:Build:Release:MacCvsX.app
